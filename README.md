# PixelPaint

The year is 1998, drawing programs are all the rage, and people want more fun with their newfound creativity. Then they found PixelPaint, a fun, silly, free paint game that is constantly growing!

I was slightly new to coding when I made this, and I decided, after learning a bit in Java-Processing, to make a fun Paint Program! :D

THIS IS VERY OLD AND I AM NO LONGER SUPPORTING IT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
